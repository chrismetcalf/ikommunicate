Introduction to Signal K with iKommunicate

Welcome to our iKommunicate SDK on GitHub. This SDK is intended to help developers quickly get to grips with the our iKommunicate NMEA to Signal K gateway, with example web apps that show how to use the HTTP restAPI or Web Sockets to access the Signal K data of your boat.

The SDK documentation is included in the associated Wiki.
